    <h2> HTML/CSS</h2>
    <p>
        while HTML and CSS are not really programming language but they are the backbone for web develpomentand ever web deveolper
        must learn them.
    </p>
    <p>
        HTML provides the structure while CSS provides the style and helps them to look better and more visually appealing.
        If you want to become a serious frontend developer then you must master these two in 2022.
    </p>
    <p>
        The good thing about them is that you can easily master them in a few weeks and they are relatively easier to learn as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you need a course, I highly recommand the Build Resposive Real world Website with HTML5 and CSS3 course by Jonas Schemedmannudemy course to start with.
        It provides easiest way to learn modern web design HTML and CSS3 step-to-step from scratch witha huge project

    <h2> Javascipt</h2>
    <p> 
        In this list,Javascipt is the only language that serves both the serverand client sides.Like HTML and CSS ,Javascipt plays a
        core role in programming  user-friendly and interactive front end of most websites,regardless of scales and complexity.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, in many surveys of stack overflow, GitHub and Hired,it always remains its leading position in top commonly used coding 
        language
    </p>
    <p>
        In terms of server-side development,Javascript is a high-level programming language with multi-paradigm feature,
        dynamic typing and numerous libraries or frameworks such as Node.js,React or Vue.js that are compatible to multiple
        operating systems. 
    </p>
    
        <a href="#WDL"> Go To Top</a>
        <a name="Python"></a>
        <h2>Python</h2>
    <p>
        Python is a high-level,yet beginner-friendly language,due to its straight forward syntax and support of various libraries or tools.
        Additionally,it can work well as a scripting or object-oriented language and has strong typing,so the process of debugging is much faster.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the field of webs,Python is one of the best back-end web development language and such Pythonweb developement projects 
        as Spotify or Instagram using the Django framework written in this language.
    </p>
    <p>
       Touch processing faster than Php,Python's speed is still slower than C/C++ and Java.
       So the language does not suit Real-time apps,mobile apps or memory-intensive apps
    </p>
   
        <a href="#WDL">Go To Top</a>
        <a name="C#"></a>
        <h2>"C#"</h2>
        <p>
            Compared to the other web programming languages, C# is more special because Microsoft initially developed it for the .NET framwork.
            So getting involved in C# web development means that will be restricted to that framework.So it only has libraries
            and types available to add functionality only to the .NET.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having said that, the language still its popularity  in programming many web apps or web API's and developing video games on PC or Xbox.
        </p>
        <p> 
            C#, or pronounced as C sharp,itself is multi-purpose and object-oriented.Similar to Java, it has strong typing and is independent on platforms because of CLR.
        </p>
     
        <a href="#WDL"> Go To Top</a>
        <a name="#WDL">PHP</a>
        <h2>PHP</h2>
        <p>
            As some of PHP functions are Similar to C language's,PHP developers can add functionality to PHP by writing more plug-ins(also called add-ons or extensions)in C.More ever,untill now,
            PHP still retains basic perl-like variables of the first version and ability to be efficiently integrated into HTML. So PHP is easy for beginners to learn. 
        </p>
        <p>
            However,according to the 2022 survey of Hired, PHP is one of the "Least loved coding language" because it is not  fun to program in.Indeed ,in the competition with others,PHP proves a bit out-of-date 
            although its versions were released for improvements.
         </p>

         <a name="Ruby"></a>
         <h2>Ruby</h2>
         <p>
             When hearing of ruby on Rails web development,some often think Ruby as an abbrevation of Ruby on Rails.But the latter is effectively a common web framework written in Ruby,with typical projects on Airbnp,
             GitHub or CodeAcademy.
         </p>
         <p>
             The language itself is high-level and purely object-oriented which means "every value is an object" and  no primitive data types are available in Ruby.It also features strong ,dynamic typing automatic garpage
             collection  - a from to manage memory.
         </p>
         <p>
             Ruby's syntax is comparatively similar to that of Python and perl and quite flexible.
             Although this makes Ruby easy coders of read ,it can easily produce unpredictable run time flaws that are hard to debug.
